The code defines and tests whether the set of skew-symmetric matrices C = {B âˆˆ Mn(R) : B = -B^T} is a subspace of Mn(R), where Mn(R) is the set of n x n matrices with real entries.

The code first checks for non-emptiness by verifying whether the zero matrix belongs to C. If the zero matrix is skew-symmetric, the code appends it to C and sets a boolean variable existentZ to True. If the zero matrix is not skew-symmetric, the code sets existentZ to False and prints a message indicating that C is empty.

The code then checks whether C is closed under vector addition and scalar multiplication. To do so, the code loops over all the entries of the n x n matrices B1 and B2 and creates two skew-symmetric matrices by setting certain entries to 1 and -1. It then checks if B1 and B2 are skew-symmetric matrices by verifying whether they satisfy the condition B = -B^T. If B1 and B2 are skew-symmetric, the code checks if B1 + B2 and alphaB1 are also skew-symmetric for any scalar alpha in R, by iterating over a range of alpha values. If both conditions are satisfied, the matrices B1, B2, B1+B2, and alphaB1 are appended to C.

Finally, the code checks if C is a subspace of Mn(R) by verifying whether it satisfies two conditions: non-emptiness and closure under vector addition and scalar multiplication. If both conditions are satisfied, the code sets a boolean variable closedAM to True. If either condition is not satisfied, closedAM is set to False. If both existentZ and closedAM are True, the code prints a message indicating that C is a subspace of Mn(R). If either existentZ or closedAM is False, the code prints a message indicating that C is not a subspace of Mn(R).
